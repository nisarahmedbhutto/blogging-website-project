        <p className="m-60">
          Generative AI refers to algorithms that can generate new content or
          data that resembles existing content. This technology has gained
          prominence due to advancements in machine learning and neural
          networks, particularly in the field of deep learning. The Mechanism
          Behind Generative AI: Generative AI employs models like Generative
          Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). GANs
          consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that
          work against each other to create realistic outputs. The generator
          creates fake data, while the discriminator evaluates it against real
          data, ultimately leading to improved outputs.
